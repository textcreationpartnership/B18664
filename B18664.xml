            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF The Executors, Creditors, and Legatees of the late Countess of <hi>Portland,</hi> claiming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Patent Licensing the Exportation of White Clothes.</head>
            <p>KING <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d did renew this Grant for Licensing the Exportation of White Clothes, undressed and undyed, to Sir <hi>James Hayes</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Apsley</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust for the said late Countess, which was first Granted in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Raign to the Merchants Adventurers, and by King <hi>James</hi> the 1st. to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> the said Countess Father.</p>
            <p>The Duty taken for such License of the <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Company for each Cloth is but 16 d. and of other Merchants as they and the Patentee could agree, the highest not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 5 <hi>s.</hi> but generally they do not take above 2 <hi>s.</hi> and 6 d. for each Cloth, the whole Produce not amounting to 400 <hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>The Crown was indebted to the said Countess at her death above 8000 <hi>l.</hi> upon another Grant setled upon a valuable Consideration, and which she esteemed a good Debt, and accordingly contracted several great Debts, in hopes that it might be received, but the Executors neither have received any part of it, or are in hopes so to do.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of this Duty which was intended by the said Countess to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port some of her poor Relations and old Servants that depended wholly upon her in her life time, has been applyed towards the payment of Debts, of which seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are yet to pay, so as those poor Relations and Servants who are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress for want of receiving their Annuities; but if quite deprived thereof, must become chargeable either to the Parish or Friends.</p>
            <p>As this Patent has been of so long continuance, and never complained of for undue practice, or that the duty taken was ever thought any burthen to the Merchant Exporter, the number whereof is but about 5000 that are yearly Exported, and those chiefly by the <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Company, the Patent having nothing to do with Serges, Kersys, or any of the new Drapery, nor with any other Clothes but only those that are not fully Manufactured.</p>
            <p>It is humbly hoped that the Wisdom of this Honourable House will not conceive, that the taking away this Duty, can be any sensible advantage to the Manufactury in General, but will rather consider how sensible a loss it will be to those whose Subsistence depends upon it, and give leave accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prayer of their Petition, that a Clause (may be inserted) in the Bill for taking away the Duties on the Wollen Manufactures Exported, to secure their Right and Property for the remainder of the Term yet to come of the said Patent, which is about eight Years.</p>
